# Malware Analysis Project Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the malware analysis project. The plan consists of 11 steps that will be executed sequentially to build a comprehensive malware analysis and classification system.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Ensure Balanced Training Data
- Implement a function to analyze the distribution of samples across different classes
- Add functionality to downsample overrepresented classes or generate synthetic samples for underrepresented classes
- Ensure each class has a similar number of samples for balanced training

### 2. Generate Images for Validation Samples
- Enhance the existing `create_greyscale_image` function to process all validation samples
- Create a dedicated function to batch process all samples in the validation directory
- Store generated images in the appropriate directory structure

### 3. Train a CNN for Binary Classification
- Implement a binary classification CNN model (benign vs. malicious)
- Use the existing data augmentation functionality in image.py
- Add appropriate metrics and validation procedures
- Save the trained model for later use

### 4. Create an Ensemble with VirusTotal Data
- Implement a function to combine CNN predictions with VirusTotal API results
- Create a weighted ensemble approach that considers both sources
- Handle cases where VirusTotal data is not available

### 5. Output a CSV with Hash, Binary Classification, and Cluster/Family
- Create a function to generate a comprehensive CSV report
- Include file hash, binary classification results, and cluster/family information
- Add confidence scores and detection rates

### 6. Cluster All 300 Samples
- Implement clustering algorithms (K-means and DBSCAN)
- Separate clustering for PE and ELF files
- Optimize clustering parameters for best results
- Visualize clustering results

### 7. Train Another CNN for Cluster Identification
- Implement a multi-class CNN model for cluster/family identification
- Use the same image-based approach as the binary classifier
- Train on the clustered data
- Evaluate performance with appropriate metrics

### 8. Cross-reference with VirusTotal Data
- Verify cluster assignments using VirusTotal API
- Extract family information from VirusTotal results
- Compare with clustering results
- Adjust cluster labels based on VirusTotal information

### 9. Append Final Predictions to the Main Classification CSV
- Update the classification CSV with cluster/family predictions
- Include confidence scores for each prediction
- Add VirusTotal verification results
- Ensure all samples have complete information

### 10. Generate YARA Rules for Each Malicious Malware Class
- Implement YARA rule generation for each identified malware family
- Extract distinctive patterns from each cluster
- Create optimized rules with low false positive rates
- Test rules against the dataset

### 11. Final Evaluation and Reporting
- Evaluate the overall system performance
- Generate comprehensive reports with visualizations
- Provide insights into malware families and their characteristics
- Document the entire analysis process and results

## Implementation Details

The implementation will leverage the existing code structure:
- `script.py`: Main script containing core functionality
- `image.py`: Image generation and processing functions
- `cnn.py`: CNN model definitions and training functions

New functionality will be added to these files as needed, following the modular design pattern already established in the codebase.
